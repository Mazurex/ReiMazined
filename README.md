# ReiMazined

A modpack made by **Maz** because plain Minecraft is boring.

## What is this

ReiMazined is a **fabric** modpack designed for:
- Quality of Life
- Visual improvement
- Sensible optimization
- Making Minecraft **Beautiful**

It does **not** change gameplay.

It does **not** add content.

It does **not** include server-side mods.

You can join any server safely, or use it for a much nicer singleplayer experience.

## What does the modpack add?

ReiMazined improves the way Minecraft looks and feels without altering how it plays.

Some improvements include:
- Preset shader and resource packs
- Performance and memory optimization (sodium, culling, chunk improvements)
- Smoother menus and chat
- Improved entity and cape animations
- A cleaner, coloured, easier-to-read F3 screen
- Third-person camera improvements.

## What PC do I need?

Performance is included, but it is **not** a low-end "FPS pack", visuals and QoL are the priority.

Tested on:
- Ryzen 5 5600
- Radeon RX 9600XT 16GB
- 32GB RAM (16GB allocated)

If you are on a lower-end PC, you can still use ReiMazined by:
- Disabling shaders
- Disabling resource packs
- Lowering render and simulation distance

## Design goal
Every mod in ReiMazined was added for a reason, nothing is included just to increase the mod count.

The goal is simple: Make Minecraft feel smoother, cleaner, and more beautiful... without turning it into modded Minecraft.
